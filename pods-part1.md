# Pods

*Pods* are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A *Pod* (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/), with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers. A Pod's contents are always co-located and co-scheduled, and run in a shared context. A Pod models an application-specific "logical host": it contains one or more application containers which are relatively tightly coupled. In non-cloud contexts, applications executed on the same physical or virtual machine are analogous to cloud applications executed on the same logical host.

As well as application containers, a Pod can contain [init containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) that run during Pod startup. You can also inject [ephemeral containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/) for debugging a running Pod.

## What is a Pod?

> **Note:** You need to install a [container runtime](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/) into each node in the cluster so that Pods can run there.

The shared context of a Pod is a set of Linux namespaces, cgroups, and potentially other facets of isolation - the same things that isolate a [container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/). Within a Pod's context, the individual applications may have further sub-isolations applied.

A Pod is similar to a set of containers with shared namespaces and shared filesystem volumes.

Pods in a Kubernetes cluster are used in two main ways:

- **Pods that run a single container**. The "one-container-per-Pod" model is the most common Kubernetes use case; in this case, you can think of a Pod as a wrapper around a single container; Kubernetes manages Pods rather than managing the containers directly.
- **Pods that run multiple containers that need to work together**. A Pod can encapsulate an application composed of [multiple co-located containers](#how-pods-manage-multiple-containers) that are tightly coupled and need to share resources. These co-located containers form a single cohesive unit. Grouping multiple co-located and co-managed containers in a single Pod is a relatively advanced use case. You should use this pattern only in specific instances in which your containers are tightly coupled. You don't need to run multiple containers to provide replication (for resilience or capacity); if you need multiple replicas, see [Workload management](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/).

## Using Pods

The following is an example of a Pod which consists of a container running the image `nginx:1.14.2`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

To create the Pod shown above, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/pods/simple-pod.yaml
```

Pods are generally not created directly and are created using workload resources. See [Working with Pods](#working-with-pods) for more information on how Pods are used with workload resources.

### Workload resources for managing pods

Usually you don't need to create Pods directly, even singleton Pods. Instead, create them using workload resources such as [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) or [Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/). If your Pods need to track state, consider the [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) resource.

Each Pod is meant to run a single instance of a given application. If you want to scale your application horizontally (to provide more overall resources by running more instances), you should use multiple Pods, one for each instance. In Kubernetes, this is typically referred to as *replication*. Replicated Pods are usually created and managed as a group by a workload resource and its [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/).

See [Pods and controllers](#pods-and-controllers) for more information on how Kubernetes uses workload resources, and their controllers, to implement application scaling and auto-healing.

Pods natively provide two kinds of shared resources for their constituent containers: [networking](#pod-networking) and [storage](#pod-storage).

## Working with Pods

You'll rarely create individual Pods directly in Kubernetes—even singleton Pods. This is because Pods are designed as relatively ephemeral, disposable entities. When a Pod gets created (directly by you, or indirectly by a [controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)), the new Pod is scheduled to run on a [Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) in your cluster. The Pod remains on that node until the Pod finishes execution, the Pod object is deleted, the Pod is *evicted* for lack of resources, or the node fails.

> **Note:** Restarting a container in a Pod should not be confused with restarting a Pod. A Pod is not a process, but an environment for running container(s). A Pod persists until it is deleted.

The name of a Pod must be a valid [DNS subdomain](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names) value, but this can produce unexpected results for the Pod hostname. For best compatibility, the name should follow the more restrictive rules for a [DNS label](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-label-names).

### Pod OS

> **FEATURE STATE: `Kubernetes v1.25 [stable]`

You should set the `.spec.os.name` field to either `windows` or `linux` to indicate the operating system that the containers in that Pod require. These two are the only operating systems supported for now by Kubernetes. In the future, this list may be expanded.

The kubelet refuses to run a Pod if the value of `.spec.os.name` does not match the operating system of the node. However, in Kubernetes v1.36, the value of `.spec.os.name` does not affect how the [kube-scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/) picks a node for the Pod to run on. In any cluster where there is more than one operating system for running nodes, you should set the [kubernetes.io/os](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#kubernetes-io-os) label correctly on each node, and define pods with a `nodeSelector` based on the operating system label. The kube-scheduler assigns your pod to a node based on other criteria and may or may not succeed in picking a suitable node placement where the node OS is right for the containers in that Pod. The [Pod security standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) also use this field to avoid enforcing policies that aren't relevant to the operating system.

### Pods and controllers

You can use workload resources to create and manage multiple Pods for you. A controller for the resource handles replication and rollout and automatic healing in case of Pod failure. For example, if a Node fails, a controller notices that Pods on that Node have stopped working and creates a replacement Pod. The scheduler places the replacement Pod onto a healthy Node.

Here are some examples of workload resources that manage one or more Pods:

- [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
- [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/)
- [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset)

### Specifying a scheduling group

> **FEATURE STATE: `Kubernetes v1.35 [alpha]` (disabled by default) *(Feature Gate: GenericWorkload)*

By default, Kubernetes schedules every Pod individually. However, some tightly-coupled applications need a group of Pods to be scheduled simultaneously to function correctly.

You can link a Pod to a [PodGroup](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/podgroup-api/) using the [scheduling group](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/scheduling-group/) field (`spec.schedulingGroup`). This tells the `kube-scheduler` that the `Pod` belongs to a specific group, enabling it to apply group-level coordinated placement decisions for the entire group at once.

### Pod templates

Controllers for [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) resources create Pods from a *pod template* and manage those Pods on your behalf.

PodTemplates are specifications for creating Pods, and are included in workload resources such as [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/), and [DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/).

Each controller for a workload resource uses the `PodTemplate` inside the workload object to make actual Pods. The `PodTemplate` is part of the desired state of whatever workload resource you used to run your app.

When you create a Pod, you can include [environment variables](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/) in the Pod template for the containers that run in the Pod.

The sample below is a manifest for a simple Job with a `template` that starts one container. The container in that Pod prints a message then pauses.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  template:
    # This is the pod template
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: busybox:1.28
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Hello, Kubernetes!" && sleep 3600']
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
    # The pod template ends here
```

Modifying the pod template or switching to a new pod template has no direct effect on the Pods that already exist. If you change the pod template for a workload resource, that resource needs to create replacement Pods that use the updated template.

For example, the StatefulSet controller ensures that the running Pods match the current pod template for each StatefulSet object. If you edit the StatefulSet to change its pod template, the StatefulSet starts to create new Pods based on the updated template. Eventually, all of the old Pods are replaced with new Pods, and the update is complete.

Each workload resource implements its own rules for handling changes to the Pod template. If you want to read more about StatefulSet specifically, read [Update strategy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/basic-stateful-set/#updating-statefulsets) in the StatefulSet Basics tutorial.

On Nodes, the [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet) does not directly observe or manage any of the details around pod templates and updates; those details are abstracted away. That abstraction and separation of concerns simplifies system semantics, and makes it feasible to extend the cluster's behavior without changing existing code.

## Pod update and replacement

As mentioned in the previous section, when the Pod template for a workload resource is changed, the controller creates new Pods based on the updated template instead of updating or patching the existing Pods.

Kubernetes doesn't prevent you from managing Pods directly. It is possible to update some fields of a running Pod, in place. However, Pod update operations like [`patch`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.36/#patch-pod-v1-core), and [`replace`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.36/#replace-pod-v1-core) have some limitations:

- Most of the metadata about a Pod is immutable. For example, you cannot change the `namespace`, `name`, `uid`, or `creationTimestamp` fields.
- If the `metadata.deletionTimestamp` is set, no new entry can be added to the `metadata.finalizers` list.
- Pod updates may not change fields other than `spec.containers[*].image`, `spec.initContainers[*].image`, `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds`, `spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds`, `spec.tolerations` or `spec.schedulingGates`. For `spec.tolerations`, you can only add new entries.
- When updating the `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` field, two types of updates are allowed:
  1. setting the unassigned field to a positive number;
  2. updating the field from a positive number to a smaller, non-negative number.

### Pod subresources

The above update rules apply to regular pod updates, but other pod fields can be updated through *subresources*.

- **Resize:** The `resize` subresource allows container resources (`spec.containers[*].resources`) to be updated. See [Resize Container Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/resize-container-resources/) for more details.
- **Ephemeral Containers:** The `ephemeralContainers` subresource allows [ephemeral containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/) to be added to a Pod. See [Ephemeral Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/) for more details.
- **Status:** The `status` subresource allows the pod status to be updated. This is typically only used by the Kubelet and other system controllers.
- **Binding:** The `binding` subresource allows setting the pod's `spec.nodeName` via a `Binding` request. This is typically only used by the [scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-scheduler/).
